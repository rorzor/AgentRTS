"Long after humans mastered space travel and began exploring the greater cosmos, we become aware of the remnants of an extinct alien civilisation, known as the 'Collectors'.

Worlds formerly inhabited by these beings, spread widely throughout the galaxy, are slowly being discovered. Though they have long been untouched by intelligent will, they remain rich with advanced technology and highly valuable resources.

However, ancient dormant systems of security and protection still persist to endanger all but the most intrepid and cunning prospector.

The moment a warp gate is opened to a newly discovered Collector world, a torrent of explorers venture into the local system to attempt to reap the rewards of the ancient planet.

Due to the limited warp capacity of the gates, they can each bring with then only a small ship equipped with the latest 'Replicator' technology. 

Upon landing, they must explore the [environment], making [observations] and taking [actions] as a replicant before training and deploying further replicants. These actions can be to collect resources, build other equipment, or battle opponents."

At any time a replicant [AI agent] can be left to its devices, and will attempt to continue carrying out actions based on how it has acted so far.

The player can spawn a new replicant when it has enough resources. The new replicant can either act with an existing policy, or the player can 'play' as the replicant, essentially training a new policy.

There would be a small number of 'upgrades' that can be researched with sufficient resources, most of which directly affect the performance of the replicant AI. these could be:
*increased observation space (eg 5x5 to 6x6 grid)
*Increased maximum number of observations possible to train a policy
 

The objective is general RTS style- collect enough resources to produce enough replicates to battle and defeat the other human players.

Current main objective is to collect and be in possession of enough of the rarest of resources, which is always heavily guarded by hostile NPCs in order to research the final technology tier.
